                <h2>Project Overview &amp; Vision</h2>
                <p><em>PhysicianConnect</em> is a centralized platform that simplifies communication between patients,
                    physicians, and receptionists. We aim to reduce administrative friction, improve communication, and
                    make it easier to manage appointments, billing, prescriptions, referrals and patient data in one
                    place.</p>

                <p>Physicians can set their availability, review pre-visit notes, and handle post-visit tasks like
                    writing prescriptions, making referrals, and logging follow-ups all in one place. Patients can
                    easily book appointments, receive updates, and access their medical information. Receptionists gain
                    tools to coordinate visits, handle billing, and keep the clinic running smoothly.
                </p>

                <p>Fast, focused, and secure, PhysicianConnect cuts through the complexity of traditional EMRs so
                    clinics can stay organized and deliver better care with less time spent on paperwork and more time
                    focused on people.

                <ul class="team-list">
                    <li>Dolla Gagandeep <span class="skill">Throughout the project, I focused a lot on maintaining clean
                            Git workflows, managing feature branches, resolving tricky merge conflicts, and keeping our
                            history organized. I also worked on writing meaningful tests using JUnit, which helped
                            improve reliability as we added more features. Since we were working as a team, I got to
                            apply what I’ve learned from past courses and work experience about writing modular,
                            testable code and making sure my changes integrated smoothly with everyone else’s work. This
                            project really helped me sharpen those collaboration and debugging skills that matter in
                            real-world development.</span></li>
                    <li>Islam Mohammad Mujahidul <span class="skill">Taking the summer version of 3350 gave me a good
                            idea of how teams usually work day to day, since we were putting in hours similar to a
                            normal job. Working with tight deadlines brought out a level of productivity in me I didn’t
                            know I had. I learned most about persistence from 3350, since I didn’t take 3380. I also got
                            a much better understanding of why testing is important and how to actually do it properly,
                            something I almost completely ignored in older projects. In terms of implementing features,
                            while my mindset was initially focused more on just building things, I gradually shifted
                            toward writing code that followed solid principles. Planning features with user stories
                            helped me structure ideas better, something I will keep using as a tool for future projects.
                            I also got solid experience with Git, like handling branches, fixing merge conflicts, and
                            working in a shared repo.</span></li>
                    <li>Jhanji Pankaj <span class="skill"> I think for me it would definitely have to be learning to get
                            into a more leadership role/ QA role. Learning to go through other people’s code and leave
                            feedback as a TA but this time around I was able to have a back and forth with them which
                            was very nice, alongside that there was also the idea of finding bugs and assigning tickets,
                            having to jump into various parts of the project to help out wherever I could. All these
                            were very fun skills that I think developed further. </span></li>
                    <li>Sarkar Arjun <span class="skill">One specific development skill I gained through this project
                            would be learning how to manage and fuse feature branches effectively in a team environment.
                            Even though I was familiar with Git before, through this project it taught me how to manage
                            more complex workflows that involve working with multiple contributors, code reviews and
                            merge conflicts. I am getting better at writing cleaner commits, discussing merge conflict
                            issues with the team and structuring branches logically. Another useful experience I gained
                            working in this project is working with a variety of user types such as physicians, and
                            receptionists (and patients too but time didn’t permit us to do so). It is cool to view each
                            user’s unique views and permissions. To me, testing and building these user types assisted
                            me into thinking deeply about access control, user interface, authentication and overall
                            user experience. It made me think critically about how each feature as well as user stories
                            should behave depending on who is using it.</span></li>
                    <li>Ibrahim Mamman <span class="skill">This project gave me a much stronger understanding of how Git
                            works in a real team setting. Before this, I had only used Git in a basic way, but now I
                            feel confident using branches, resolving merge conflicts, and contributing to a shared repo.
                            I also learned a lot about teamwork—how to communicate effectively, coordinate tasks, and
                            make sure everyone's changes fit together. On top of that, I really came to appreciate the
                            software development cycle, especially Agile. I liked the rhythm of working in sprints,
                            writing user stories, and regularly checking in to adapt our plans. It made the whole
                            process feel more organized and productive.</span></li>
